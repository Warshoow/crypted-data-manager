Crypted-data-manager
====================

*This project was carried out for learning and testing purposes*

*I'm no expert, the interface and the code is shitty but functional*

The idea behind this project is linked to the problem of storing personal data in the cloud.
It's easy to imagine that the data was encrypted once it was sent to the cloud.
However, for the more sceptical, storing data in the infrastructure of an organisation that also holds your passwords and the key to decrypting your data may seem somewhat problematic.

This little project is based on that idea, encrypting the data and then sending it to a secure cloud, to take advantage of its benefits.

**Unreadable data is useless data**
